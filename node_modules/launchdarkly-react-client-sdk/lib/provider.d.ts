/**
 * The `LDProvider` is a component which accepts a config object which is used to
 * initialize `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`.
 *
 * This Provider does three things:
 * - It initializes the ldClient instance by calling `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` initialize on `componentDidMount`
 * - It saves all flags and the ldClient instance in the context API
 * - It subscribes to flag changes and propagate them through the context API
 *
 * Because the `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` in only initialized on `componentDidMount`, your flags and the
 * ldClient are only available after your app has mounted. This can result in a flicker due to flag changes at
 * startup time.
 *
 * This component can be used as a standalone provider. However, be mindful to only include the component once
 * within your application. This provider is used inside the `withLDProviderHOC` and can be used instead to initialize
 * the `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`. For async initialization, check out the `asyncWithLDProvider` function
