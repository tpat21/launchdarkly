/**
 * `withLDProvider` is a function which accepts a config object which is used to
 * initialize `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`.
 *
 * This HOC handles passing configuration to the `LDProvider`, which does the following:
 * - It initializes the ldClient instance by calling `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` initialize on `componentDidMount`
 * - It saves all flags and the ldClient instance in the context API
 * - It subscribes to flag changes and propagate them through the context API
 *
 * The difference between `withLDProvider` and `asyncWithLDProvider` is that `withLDProvider` initializes
 * `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` at `componentDidMount`. This means your flags and the ldClient are only available after
 * your app has mounted. This can result in a flicker due to flag changes at startup time.
 *
 * `asyncWithLDProvider` initializes `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` at the entry point of your app prior to render.
 * This means that your flags and the ldClient are ready at the beginning of your app. This ensures your app does not
 * flicker due to flag changes at startup time.
 *
 * @param config - The configuration used to initialize LaunchDarkly's JS SDK
 * @return A function which accepts your root React component and returns a HOC
